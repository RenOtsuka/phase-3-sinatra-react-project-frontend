## Features

This repository breaks down the application into components, to manage each task that said application can do, which are: 

- Display the to-do/category list on the webpage
- Dispaly what tasks are under a given category
- Add a new task and category, via form
- Edit any current existing task
- Delete any existing task

Theese tasks are sectioned into two pages which can be seen below in a short demo respectively
